### ðŸ˜Š This is me

- ðŸ’« How do we travel to distant galaxies? How was â€˜zeroâ€™ discovered? What is the meaning of The Starry Night? I have wondered about these at some point in my life. An explorer at heart, I love the thrill of adventure and finding answers to questions that life poses. I hope to discover the same thrill in the work that I do. 
- ðŸŒ± So imagine my happiness when I found the perfect way to solve complex problems- code! Currently exploring different methods of coding like dynamic programming, data analysis and graphs. Astronomy, and wondering how the universe works, is a topic close to heart, and thus I love applying the knowledge of coding to finding those answers. If you want a quick tour, visit [Astronomy_Projects](https://github.com/risha-daz/Astronomy_projects) for some interesting stuff.
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on designing a voice enabled web application for space weather forecast. Using the SWASTi Framework and written in python (Flask), JavaScript (Reactjs)
